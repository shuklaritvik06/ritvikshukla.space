Welcome to my space on the internet.

This blog is where I document how modern systems are actually built — from first principles to production. It reflects my work and thinking as a developer working at the intersection of **AI systems, distributed backend architecture, cloud infrastructure, and full-stack engineering**.

Most of what you’ll find here is grounded in things I’ve shipped: production RAG pipelines, multi-agent orchestration, event-driven systems, real-time streaming architectures, and large-scale cloud infrastructure. I care deeply about correctness, scalability, and pragmatic design — not demos.

This blog is intentionally technical. I write to clarify my own thinking, share real implementation lessons, and explore ideas that sit one layer below the hype. If something helps another builder reason more clearly about systems, it’s doing the job.
