summary: Hello world — a place to think, build, and write about modern systems.

Hi, world 👋

This is the beginning of a long-overdue habit: writing things down.

I spend most of my time building and breaking complex systems — LLM-powered products, agentic workflows, distributed backends, cloud infrastructure, and increasingly, intersections with blockchain and decentralised primitives. A lot of learning happens along the way, but too much of it stays trapped in my head or scattered across notebooks and commits.

This blog is my attempt to fix that.

Here, I’ll mostly write about:
- LLMs beyond prompts: orchestration, evaluation, observability
- Agentic AI systems and real production trade-offs
- Retrieval, embeddings, and vector pipelines at scale
- Event-driven systems, queues, and real-time architectures
- Blockchain systems where they actually make sense
- Lessons from shipping things

No polished thought leadership. No motivational fluff. Just clear thinking, diagrams, and code-level reasoning from someone actively building in production.

If you’re also trying to understand how these systems *really* work — welcome.
